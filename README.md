# PEPPOL invoice support by large organizations
Shows which large organizations are sending invoices through the [PEPPOL-network](https://peppol.eu/what-is-peppol/) for faster processing of invoices.

## What is PEPPOL?
PEPPOL is a set of artifacts and specifications enabling cross-border eProcurement ([source](https://peppol.eu/what-is-peppol/)). **Simply said**: a means of making e.g. invoicing faster and less error-prone through a standardized data format.

Imagine receiving an invoice from a company, not having to manually put in into your bookkeeping software, but having all major fields (sender, invoice date/number, lines, totals, etc.) automatically filled out for you. A massive time-saver. PEPPOL makes this scalable at a global level.

## PEPPOL support per country
The tables below indicate per company whether they are able to send UBL-invoices and/or via the PEPPOL-network. Explanation of the columns:
- **Company**: The company name, in alphabetical order.
- **UBL status**: Whether the company can send UBL-invoices (in .xml format), as an alternative to PDF invoices. Allows the receiving party to import an .xml file which automatically fills out all major fields (sender, invoice date/number, lines, totals, etc.).
- **PEPPOL status**: Whether the company can send UBL-invoices through the PEPPOL-network, allowing the receiving party to automatically receive invoices in their bookkeeping software. Eliminates the need for the receiving party to upload PDF/UBL invoices into their bookkeeping software. 
- **Explanation**: Short description why the company isn't supporting UBL/PEPPOL yet, or short statement from the company that UBL/PEPPOL isn't supported yet.
